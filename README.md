# nonnas-recipes

This site contains a recipe management app for my grandma. It is mostly AI generated. It is a remake of a website that my grandpa originally made for her (which is snapshotted in the `save` directory), and the vintage styling is taken from there.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
